Version 0.8.1:
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed a bug that made it impossible to select a secondary weapon that is your very first outfit.
    * Made the scroll wheel affect the column the mouse is hovering over in the load / save panel.
    * Fixed the Windows random number generator to not produce the same fleets every time you visit a given system.
    * Fixed a bug where paying a bribe could result in negative credits.
    * Additive blending now works correctly for @2x (high resolution) sprites.
  * Changes to game mechanics:
    * Disabled escorts are no longer lost if you land; instead they just remain where they are, disabled.
    * Missions that can't be completed yet due to an NPC requirement or waypoint are now "dimmed out."
    * Added the ability to mark missions as "minor" so they will not interrupt story line missions.
    * Modified the AI to leave disabled ships alone (unless it plunders them).
  * Improved graphics:
    * Replaced some landscape images with higher-resolution ones.
    * Replaced most of the space staion landscape images with NASA images.
    * Modified some projectile sprites to be more detailed.
    * Switched the colors of the mission pointers to be easier for color blind people to distinguish.
    * Toned down the brightness of the galaxy backdrop image in the map.
  * Development:
    * Added a debug mode (-d / --debug).
    * Made the slow-motion key (caps lock) and pause key (backtick) only work in debug mode.
  * Optimization:
    * Added a limit of 20 landscapes loaded at once, to reduce memory usage.

Version 0.8.0:
  * First stable release.
