	description "Ion cannons do not do as much damage as some other weapons, but they disrupt the electrical systems on any ship they hit, draining its energy. If a ship has sizeable battery reserves, this may not have any effect, but for a ship running at near its energy generation capacity an ion strike can take it out of the battle for a few seconds while it recovers."

	description "Centuries ago, space battles were fought mostly with missiles, with the outcome dependent only on which ship had more shielding or ammunition. Lovelace Labs was originally founded to remedy that situation by developing a protective system that could shoot missiles out of the air, defending freighter convoys from pirates who could otherwise simply bombard them into submission without ever venturing within range of their guns."

	description "The Heavy Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller sibling. The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can get through, and as a result all missile systems on the market now default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed, rather than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."

	description "When trying to cram as many high-powered outfits as possible into a ship, occasionally you reach the point where it is sporadically overheating and shutting down. In that case, you may need to install one of these."

	"outfit space" -10
	"energy capacity" 1000
	description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 2200
	description "This battery pack has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

	"outfit space" -40
	"energy capacity" 4800
	description "This medium-sized battery pack is intended for ships that need to fire the occasional salvo of high-powered weaponry without running out of energy. As with all battery packs, relying on batteries is risky if combat lasts long enough for them to become depleted."

	"energy capacity" 10400
	description "This is a large battery pack designed for ships that may occasionally have high power needs but do not want the expense or the heat associated with a more powerful ship's generator."

	cost 380000
	thumbnail "outfit/huge battery hai"
	"mass" 160
	"outfit space" -160
	"energy capacity" 23000
	description "For most ships that require this much power, a larger generator makes more sense than a battery this size. However, battery packs have the advantage that they generate no heat, so some captains use them instead of powerful generators if they do not expect to be in combat frequently or for extended periods of time."

	description "A Dwarf Core is a miniaturized nuclear reactor, small enough to be installed in any ship larger than a fighter. It was designed by Deep Sky to be paired with their power-hungry atomic engines."

	description "Fission reactors have been a mainstay of large military vessels since even before the dawn of the space era. Today's models are very safe and efficient, but some pilots still find them disconcerting."

	description "If you're looking for the most powerful engine that will fit into your ship, and have plenty of money to burn, Deep Sky's atomic thrusters are your answer. Of course, the extra energy and cooling they require can easily offset the benefit of their small size."

	description "This thruster is small enough to fit in a light warship or freighter, but powerful enough to move any but the largest of ships. Naturally, such performance comes at an exorbitant price."

	description "If your ship is sporting a set of Deep Sky's atomic engines, you will be the envy of every pilot in the galaxy. No other form of propulsion that humanity has discovered produces so much thrust from such a small engine."

	description "The A860 atomic thruster is the most powerful engine sold in human space, and is much more compact than any of the alternatives. But, you may need to upgrade your ship's power and cooling systems to handle it."

	description "This set of maneuvering thrusters from Deep Sky will allow small warships to turn as fast as a fighter. For larger ships, swapping the existing engines with a set of atomics can free up a considerable amount of space for other outfits or weapons."

	description "For pilots who want to be able to pull fancy tricks that most ships are not capable of emulating, a reverse thruster allows a ship to accelerate backwards, without needing to turn around. Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."
